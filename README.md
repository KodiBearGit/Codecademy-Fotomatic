## General info
Project goal is to fix a broken version of a responsive website called FotoMatic
* use skils acquired in Chrome DevTools article to decipher and update the site's CSS
* use Git version control
* compare broken site with spec sheet to determine what is needed.  
* this project occurs in this full-stack-path prior to teaching of media queries.  I did take notes on a previous path so I was aware (somewhat) of how to take care of this or at least be able find info on it.  I sympathize with anyone that is doing this without such knowledge.

* the reset.css was required.
